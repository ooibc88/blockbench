# BlockBench

BlockBench is the first benchmarking framework for private blockchain systems.
It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding
of different system design choices.

BlockBench comes with both [macro benchmark workloads](src/macro) for evaluating the overall performance and
[micro benchmark workloads](src/micro) for evaluating performance of individual layers. 

*** A new version for Fabric 1.0 upward will be released soon ***

## Workloads 

### Macro-benchmark

* YCSB (KVStore).
* SmallBank (OLTP).

### Micro-benchmark

* DoNothing (consensus layer).
* IOHeavy (data model layer, read/write oriented).
* Analytics (data model layer, analytical query oriented).
* CPUHeavy (execution layer).

## Source file structure

+ Smart contract sources are in [benchmark/contracts](benchmark/contracts) directory.
+ Instructions and scripts to run benchmarks for Ethereum, Hyperledger , Parity and Quorum are in [ethereum](benchmark/ethereum),
[hyperledger](benchmark/hyperledger) , [parity](benchmark/parity) , [quorum_raft](benchmark/quorum_raft) and [quorum_vote](benchmark/quorum_vote) directories respectively.
+ Drivers for benchmark workloads are in [src](src) directory.

## Dependency

### C++ libraries
* [restclient-cpp](https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp)

  Note: we patched this library to include the "Expect: " header in POST requests, which considerably improves the speed for
  processing RPC request at Parity. 

    + The patch file is include in [benchmark/parity](benchmark/parity) folder.
    + To patch: go to top-level directory of restclient-cpp, then:

        `patch -p4 < $BLOCK_BENCH_HOME/benchmark/parity/patch_restclient`

    + The installation can then proceed as normal. 

* [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)

* Docker-Container
  The `container` folder contains a Dockerfile that creates a Docker
container with all required C++ dependencies. You can use this Container
to build the kvstore workload

### Node.js libraries
Go to [micro](src/micro) directory and use `npm install` to install the dependency libraries
* [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)
* [zipfian](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zipfian)
* [bignumber.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bignumber.js)
